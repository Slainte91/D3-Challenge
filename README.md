The purpose of this project is to sift through data and provide interesting visualizations.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
